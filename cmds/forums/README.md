We currently have four group categories: Public, Tier 1, Tier 2, and Whiteline. These groups exist purely for organizational clarity and easier navigation—they are not required for functionality. If any of these groups are changed, make sure to update Bot.py accordingly.

There are two types of forum updaters in use:

- Older updaters: EU, US, and Hamburg — these are legacy versions but still function correctly, use if your links are not the same 
  - Exmaple: `Link 1`: "https://cdn.britannica.com/33/4833-050-F6E415FE/Flag-United-States-of-America.jpg", 
  `Link 2`: "https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/thumbnails/027/003/007/small/usa-flag-wave-american-flag-flag-of-usa-vector.jpg"

- Newer updaters: More consistent, use if your links are the same expect for the last nunmber
   - Example: `Link 1`: "https://futurecrew.sirv.com/images/german/0.png" `Link 2`: "https://futurecrew.sirv.com/images/german/1.png"

You may choose either version, but the newer updaters are recommended.

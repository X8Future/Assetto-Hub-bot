We currently have four group categories: Public, Tier 1, Tier 2, and Whiteline. These groups exist purely for organizational clarity and easier navigation—they are not required for functionality. If any of these groups are changed, make sure to update Bot.py accordingly.

There are two types of forum updaters in use:

- Older updaters: EU, US, and Hamburg — these are legacy versions but still function correctly.

- Newer updaters: More consistent and better maintained.

You may choose either version, but the newer updaters are recommended.
